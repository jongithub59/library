# Project: Library

## The Odin Project 

An interactive digital library where you can add, read, and delete books. From the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

Live preview [here](https://jongithub59.github.io/library/).

## Features

* Add books through a pop up dialog box and type the name, author, and page number of the book, and whether you read it or not.
* Change whether you've read a book after you added it by toggling a read button.
* Delete a book from the library with the press of a button.
* Display area for books will accomodate for as many books as needed.
* Responsive design for all screen sizes.

## Reflection

* Learned to use event.PreventDefault() to avoid undesirable outcomes when closing the dialog window.
* Learned how to better create responsive grids using auto-fit and minmax().
* Gained familiarity with using arrays.
* Better understanding of the "this" keyword.
* Learned how to use objects and the constructor.
